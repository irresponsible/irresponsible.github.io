		<p>anarchy is a business logic library that models problems as a table of conditions and actions. It has been designed so that non-technical users can understand it and it is intended that it is used in conjunction with a user interface to enable end-users to edit the logic.</p>

		<p>codependence is a modern dependency resolution library that enables you to structure your application as pure data.</p>
		<p>With this release, we are sunsetting the venerable oolong. Active development will no longer occur on oolong except in response to github issues. Oolong remains stable and production-ready, we just think codependence is a lot better.</p>

		<span class="date">posted 2017-03-18</span>
		<span class="author">by jjl</span>
	      </div>
	      <div class="news-body">
		<p>tentacles is a client library for the github api.</p>
		<p>We have adopted tentacles owing to the passing away of its previous maintainer, Antony Grimes (Raynes). Antony was a huge influence in the clojure community and a profilic open source contributor. He will be missed, but his memory will live on in his software and in the memories of those who knew him.</p>
